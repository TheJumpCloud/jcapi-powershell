        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a RADIUS Server, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this RADIUS server instance.

        This endpoint will return all Systems bound to a User Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User Group to the corresponding System; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System from this User Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Systems bound to a User, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the corresponding System; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System from this User.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint allows you to create a new workday instance.

        You must supply a username and password for `Basic Authentication` that is the same as your WorkDay Integrator System User.  Failure to provide these credentials  will result in the request being rejected.

        Currently `O-Auth` isn't a supported authentication protocol for WorkDay, but will be in the future.

        Currently, only one instance is allowed and it must be `Workday Import`.
