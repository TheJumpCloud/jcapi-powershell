      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to an Active Directory instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Active Directory instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this Active Directory instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all User Groups bound to an G Suite instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this G Suite instance to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group from this G Suite instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users bound to an Office 365 instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Office 365 instance to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this Office 365 instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Systems bound to a Policy, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Policy to the corresponding System; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System from this Policy.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Users bound to a RADIUS Server, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this RADIUS server instance.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Users bound to a System Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System Group to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this System Group.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all Commands bound to a System, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System to the corresponding Command; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Command from this System.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will return all RADIUS Servers bound to a User, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.

        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.

        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.

        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the corresponding RADIUS Server; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the RADIUS Server from this User.

        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those collections.
